DisplayCAL Python 3 Project
===========================

This project intended to modernize the DisplayCAL code including Python 3 support.

Florian HÃ¶ch, the original developer, did an incredible job of creating and maintaining
DisplayCAL for all these years. But, it seems that, during the pandemic, very
understandably, he lost his passion to the project. Now, it is time for us, the
DisplayCAL users, to contribute back to this great tool.

This project is based on the ``HEAD`` of the Sourceforge version, which has 5 extra
commits that Florian has created after the ``3.8.9.3`` release on 14 Jan 2020.

Status Update (10 March 2022)
-----------------------------

Here is one of the early screenshots showing the tool working with Python 3.9:

Currently, DisplayCAL is working with Python 3.9.7 + wxPython 4.1.1.

Here is a list of things that is working:

- The UI and general functionality.
- Calibration + Profiling.
- Installing the created profile.
- Installing the created profile as root.
- Profile info window.
- and a lot of other stuff is working properly.

What is not working (yet)
-------------------------

- ~~Language support, all the menus are showing the bare keys of the items. This will soon
  be fixed.~~ (Fixed)
- There are tons of ``bytes/str`` related issues, getting fixed very quickly but more
  tests are needed.
- Please create [issues](https://github.com/eoyilmaz/displaycal-py3/issues)

How to install
--------------

Currently, there is no ``RPM``, ``DEB``, ``APP`` or ``MSI`` packages. 
To test the code you can either run it directly from the source or install it as a ``sdist`` package.  To do this: 


## Local install
Prequisties:
* Assorted C/C++ builder tools
* dbus-1
* glib 2.0
* gtkd 3
* libxxf86vm
* pkg-config

Please install these from your package manager. 

```shell
# Brew on Macs
brew install pkg-config dbus glib gtk+3 libxxf86vm

# Debian installs
apt-get install build-essential dbus libglib2.0-dev pkg-config libgtkd-3-dev libxxf86vm-dev
```

Then 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/eoyilmaz/displaycal-py3
cd ./displaycal-py3/
python setup.py install
```

This should install the code as an ``sdist``. To run the UI:

```shell
displaycal

# Alt:
scripts/displaycal
```

You may need to browse to the ``bin`` folder of you ``python`` interpreter. I used a
``virtualenv`` through ``PyCharm`` to develop and test the code.

## Docker install
We have now added a Docker image to the repository for a shared development environment across the project

OSX only: If you intend to try to use the Docker image, please see 
[these instructions](http://mamykin.com/posts/running-x-apps-on-mac-with-docker/) 
because you'll need an X server.  Test them with `make xquartz-test` and some Googly eyes should start following your mouse.  


```shell
make docker-build
make docker-run

# I want a shell for debugging instead
make docker-sh
scripts/displaycal  # In the docker container
````

ATTENTION!
----------

Previously the ``--install-data=$HOME/.local`` option has to be used with the
``setup.py`` script in order to let the DisplayCAL to find the required data files. But
it is not needed anymore, and it is a good idea to delete the ``DisplayCAL*`` files and
folders from the ``site-packages`` folder of your ``python`` interpreter if you used
that option in a previous version of ``DisplayCAL-py3``.

Road Map
--------

Some ideas on where to focus on future development:

- Try to move the UI to Qt. This is a big ticket. The motivation behind that is that I'm
  much more experienced with Qt. In fact, I have zero experience with ``wxPython``.
- Make the code fully compliant with PEP8 with the modification of hard wrapping the
  code at 88 characters instead of 80 characters. This also means a lot of class and
  method/function names will be changed.
- Create unit tests with ``Pytest`` and reach to 100% code coverage. The ``3.8.9.3``
  version of DisplayCAL is around 120k lines of Python code (other languages are not
  included) and there are no tests (or the repository I adapted doesn't contain any
  tests). This is a nightmare and super hard to maintain.
- Maybe I'm not experienced enough, and I'm wrong on saying this, but I don't see the
  motivation behind having a C-Extension for ``EDID``, ``XRandr`` etc. stuff. It should
  be possible to cover all the functionality of this extension and stay purely in
  Python. It is super hard to debug (for me at least) and super hard to maintain (again,
  for me).
- Replace the ``wexpect.py`` with the latest release of ``Pexpect``. I'm not very
  familiar with this module, and there is no comment in the code on why we have
  a ``wexpect.py`` instead of using the PyPI version of ``Pexpect``.
- Replace the ``DisplayCAL.ordereddict.OrderedDict`` with the pure Python ``dict`` which
  is ordered after Python 3.6.
- Replace ``os.path`` related stuff with ``pathlib``.
- Organize the module structure, move UI related stuff in to ``ui`` module etc., move
  non-source files into their own folders.
- Remove all the hackery that includes ``exec()``. I know, there should be a reason for
  them to exist, but this generally is considered as ``hacking``.
- Update the ``Remaining time`` calculation during profiling to estimate the time by
  also considering the luminance of the remaining patches to have a better estimation.
  Because, patches with higher luminance values are measured quickly than patches with
  lower luminance values.

Issues related to these ideas have been created. If you have a feature request, you can
create more issues or share your comment on the already created issues or create merge
requests that are fixing little or big things.

Because there are very little automated tests, **I need the code to be tested
constantly**. Please help me with that.

Have fun!
